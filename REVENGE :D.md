REI-LYN POV:


I let out a sigh as I moved on to my next doodle, flipping to an empty space on my worksheet and drawing yet another turtle. My calligraphy and small sketches had already filled almost the whole page in the short time that I have been dying in this classroom, listening to the teacher's voice drone on and on. 
"Okay, class, please take out your phones." 
My ears perked up at those words almost instantly. My heart started beating a little faster. I whipped out my phone quickly, entering Whatsapp to check the picture the teacher sent. While that, I was watching at the corner of my eye, the movements of the person next to me. 
Will he...? 
I needn't have waited a second longer. He got up and dragged his chair beside me. 
"Rei-Lyn, what did cher send?" He shifted closer to me to take a look at my phone. My cheeks started turning red. Oh. God. No. Nonono. Not wanting my heart to go anymore crazier, I focused on the picture that the teacher sent, and tried my hardest to ignore the fact that he was leaning close to me. 
My attention, failing me, drifted from the text to him. My eyes looked at his, the concentration in his eyes, his round glasses reflecting light, it was as if he was giving off a glow. Like the world wanted all my attention to be directed at him. I hate to say, it worked.
"okay, class, please discuss in your group of fours." 
I was silent as he started the discussion. My gaze lingering on his face. 
"What do you think, Rei-Lyn?" His attention was now directed at me, a small smile on his lips.
"I..." I sat awkwardly, my hands twisted together and I picked at my fingernail nervously. I was so focused on him, I hadn't been listening to what he was saying. His eyebrow raised slightly, lips slowly curling into a small smirk. "Well?" He asks again. 
"What... What did you say again?" Face flushed, i asked him uncomfortably, avoiding his gaze. I waited for him to answer then look away, but he didn't, he merely continued to look at me and patiently explained it again. 
He leaned a little closer towards me, and I instinctively jerked back a bit, afriad that my cheeks would turn redder than it already was. 
"G-Great idea." I stammered, praying that my voice wouldn't give away my feelings for him. I turned my body so i wasn't facing him anymore. The image of him appeared in my brain, again. He's just a friend, right? Ray is just a friend. 
I desperately cracked a joke, hoping to brush away my embarassment and engage a conversation with Clarisse instead, i regretted it seconds after i said it, though. He tipped his head back lightly and gave out a small chuckle. I couldn't turn my gaze away. Oh god. Why is my heart beating so fast? DAMMIT, i should have just grown my fringe so it covers my entire face and i will never have to feel like this ever again
I really wanna tell him. I do. But will it ruin our friendship? I'm sure he only sees me as a friend.
